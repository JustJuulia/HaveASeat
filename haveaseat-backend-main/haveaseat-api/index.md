# The **Have a Seat** api documentation


## Overview 

### Purpose of the whole **Have a Seat** project

After the pandemic, many companies, including **Sagra**, adopted a hybrid work model. Each employee is required to come to the office on a certain number of days in a week. However, most desks were not being used, making it practical to reduce the number of desks significantly. The **Have a Seat** project, a desk reservation program, was designed to address this issue and help employees choose the days they want to work in the office.

### Purpose of the **Have a Seat** api

The **Have a Seat** api is designed to link the frontend side of the project to the database.

### Audience

**This api is intended for**:

- **Developers**: Linking the project to the Microsoft Teams system of the company.
- **IT Administrators**: Managing and maintaining the API and database.
- **Future Developers**: Continuing the development and maintenance of the project and adding new features as needed.
